            Linkin Park is an American rock band from Agoura Hills, California. 
            The band's current lineup comprises vocalist/rhythm guitarist Mike Shinoda, 
            lead guitarist Brad Delson, bassist Dave Farrell, DJ/turntablist Joe Hahn and drummer Rob Bourdon,
            all of whom are founding members. Vocalists Mark Wakefield and Chester Bennington are former members of the band. 
            Categorized as alternative rock, Linkin Park's earlier music spanned a fusion of heavy metal and hip hop,
            while they later transitioned into more electronica- and pop-influenced music.

            Formed in 1996, Linkin Park rose to international fame with their debut studio album, Hybrid Theory (2000), 
            which became certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
            Released during the peak of the nu metal scene, the album's singles' heavy 
            airplay on MTV led the singles "One Step Closer", "Crawling" 
            and "In the End" all to chart highly on the Mainstream Rock chart; 
            the latter crossed over to the pop chart. Their second album, 
            Meteora (2003), continued the band's success. The band explored 
            experimental sounds on their third album, Minutes to Midnight (2007).
            By the end of the decade, Linkin Park was among the most successful and popular rock acts.

            The band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types on their fourth album, A Thousand Suns (2010),
            layering their music with more electronic sounds. 
            The band's fifth album, Living Things (2012), combined musical elements from all of their previous records. 
            Their sixth album, The Hunting Party (2014), returned to a heavier rock sound, and their seventh album, 
            One More Light (2017), was their first pop-oriented record.
            Linkin Park went on a hiatus when longtime lead vocalist Bennington died in July 2017. 
            In April 2020, bassist Dave Farrell revealed the band was working on new music.
